Test Orange Pi Zero, Raspberry Pi Zero W (Opi >> Rpi due to availability)
Drop Java implementation -> unnecessary due to interface moving from screen/Gui to web based API
Use python to run threads where arp logger and web server will be on different threads. (T1 arp parser, T2 web server)
changed tdb -> Log Base and pdb -> Reg Base
Log Base to be permanent with new table each day
Log Base to contain enter and leave DateTime
Python script in T1 to do current arp comparison with database and add/update records
Web server to implement control API -> no more screen, api as only interface
Review security implementation of the API -> manual handshake enough or use other used and confirmed safe technology
Try RTC with Opi-armbian, test internet/no internet and power/no power. Test sync when connected to internet
Test power holding circuit.
